# Introduction :

## How Machine learning works : 
    
    *data -> Features extracted as Vectors -> Code to set Rules -> Outcome/Prediction*


## Popular Machine Learning techniques and their applications:

    1. Regression : Predict continuous value
    2. Classification : Category prediction
    3. Clustering : Segmentation
    4. Association : Events that co occur
    5. Anomaly detection : Abnormal unusual cases
    6. Sequence mining : Predicting the next event
    7. Dimension Reduction : To reduce the size of data
    8. Recomendation System : As the name says


## Libraries to work with in Python for Data and ML:
    1. NumPy
    2. SciPy
    3. matplotlib
    4. sickitlearn -> free ml library, contains preconfigured algorithms and is configured to work with other python libraries (topic of focus)


## Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning:

Supervising Model :: Train Model with labeled dataset for it to produce outcome in the future.
Unsupervised Model :: The model is made to work on its own and discover unlabelled data and draws calculations on it. (More difficult than supervised)
